## Crime-in-Vancouver
Vancouver Open Data Catalogue (all years): The data comes from the Vancouver Open Data Catalogue. It was extracted on 2019-06-11 and contains 603,986 records from 2003-01-01 to 2019-06-7. By David Rucinski

### Objective
Identify and examine crime trends from Vancouver's data. Identify how has crime changed over the years, if certain neighbourhoods more prone to crimes, and what type of crime happens the most. In addition, this data will also give me some practice with these packages: dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate, and data.table. 

#### Using R and Markdown
Practice Markdown formatting for html output and exploratory data analysis on open crime data.
